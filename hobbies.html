        <p>This section of the portfolio is dedicated to my hobbies. This is a great place to learn more about who I am and what I enjoy doing.</p>

        <section id="Gaming">
            <h3><u>Video Games</u></h3>
            <p>I have been playing video games for as long as I can remember. My dad bought me a Wii when I was little and I remember playing New Super Mario Bro's for the 
                first time and having a blast. I began exploring different games and genres to see what was out there and one of my friends introduced me to League of Legends.
                I was instantly hooked with the gameplay and the visuals, thus began a journey of no return. I love the occasional indie games like Hollow Knight, but I always
                find myself playing League the most and sometimes Valorant. While most people would dismiss video games as a hobby and deem it as a waste of time, I would strongly diagree. Video games
                have played a vital role in my life and inspired me to pursue computer science. When deciding what to major in, I found myself questioning what I was most interested 
                in and the very first thought was: how are video games made? This curiosity caused me to explore computer science and I genuinely loved it. Without video games, my 
                major would be completely different and this website would not exist.

        <section id="Travel">
            <h3><u>Travel</u></h3>
            <p>Something that always fascinates me is that in this world, there are countless amounts of different cultures and lifestyles that are wildly different than what I am used
               to. I want to be able to experience as much as I can to expand my mind and become a more well rounded person. This developed my love for travelling and discovering what
               is out there. I always look forward to visiting China with my family because it is an opportunity to connect with my parents culture and to learn more about China's rich 
               history. Another reason why I love travelling is due to my love of food. My love of eating probably developed from constantly getting food from my parents restaurant when it
               was still operating. As I grew, my palate grew as well and I started to enjoy cuisine from other cultures as well such as sashimi which I despised as a kid. Now the thought of 
               travelling to Japan and eating fresh sashimi makes my mouth water. I can not wait to explore the world and what it has to offer.

        <section id="Fitness">
            <h3><u>Fitness</u></h3>
            <p>Keeping active and exercising the body is extremely important, especially when my major requires me to sit and stare at a computer all day. Fitness to me comes in many forms
                and constantly changed throughout my life. As a kid, fitness was in the form of a variety of sports. From taking badminton lessons to being on the highschool basketball and volleyball
                team, I was quite active. But as I got older and became more busy with typical adult duties, I found it harder and harder to continue playing sports as it required communicating with
                other people to schedule a time to play. In need of a new physical activity, in the recent years I turned to the gym as a method to stay in shape. I found the gym to not only be 
                a great way to keep fit, it was also a great way to improve my mental health. I have been continously going for 3 years now and this consistency has made my mind and body much stronger.
