            <p>I developed a workout tracker in Java allowing users to input their workouts and tracks their progress. I have been consistently going to the gym for years and I wanted
                to create an application that could benefit those who want to keep track of their fitness. Some features include keeping track of a users workout, finding progress made  
                in terms of repetitions and weight for a specific exercise, and deleting a workout. JUnit was implemented to confirm all back end functions worked as expected and 100%
                code coverage was reached. To save a user's workout history and allow their data to be saved, I imported JSON to achieve these features by convering the entries into JSON 
                objects and writing it to a file. To load a user's workout history, JSON reads the file back when the application runs again. A UI was created by using Swing, featuring
                interactive elements that are clear and concise for users. The UI allows users to view all of their entries and a taskbar with all of the features previously mentioned.
