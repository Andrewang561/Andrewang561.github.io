        <h1 id="workout_tracker_title">Workout Tracker</h1>

        <section class="workout_tracker" >
            <h4><em>Java, Java Swing, JUnit, JSON</em></h4>
            <a href="https://github.com/Andrewang561/Workout-Tracker">GitHub Link</a>
            <p>I developed a workout tracker in Java allowing users to input their workouts and tracks their progress. I have been consistently going to the gym for years and I wanted
                to create an application that could benefit those who want to keep track of their fitness. Some features include keeping track of a users workout, finding progress made  
                in terms of repetitions and weight for a specific exercise, and deleting a workout. JUnit was implemented to confirm all back end functions worked as expected and 100%
                code coverage was reached. To save a user's workout history and allow their data to be saved, I imported JSON to achieve these features by convering the entries into JSON 
                objects and writing it to a file. To load a user's workout history, JSON reads the file back when the application runs again. A UI was created by using Swing, featuring
                interactive elements that are clear and concise for users. The UI allows users to view all of their entries and a taskbar with all of the features previously mentioned.

        <h1 id="blackjack_title">Blackjack</h1>

        <section class="blackjack">
            <h4><em>Python, JSON</em></h4>
            <a href="https://github.com/Andrewang561/Black-Jack">GitHub Link</a>
            <p>Growing up, card games were always a great way to pass the time as entertainment services like Netflix and TikTok did not yet exist. It was always fun to gather friends
                and family to play a game of big two or a personal favourite of mine: fighting the landlord. I decided to make a program of an all time classic card game, blackjack, while
                simultaneously practicing my Python skills. The game follows standard rules regarding play and payout and there is even a dealer AI capable of making decisions based on its
                own hand. I added an additional feature of placing bets using virtual currency and used JSON to ensure user data would be saved throughout multiple sessions.

        <h1 id="heart_disease_title">Heart Disease Classifier</h1>

        <section class="heart_disease_classifier">
            <h4><em>R, Tidyverse, Tidymodels, Jupyter Notebook</em></h4>
            <a href="https://github.com/Andrewang561/Heart-Disease-Classifier">GitHub Link</a>
            <p>This project serves as a demonstration in my skills in both R and data science. Using R and a database containing information related to heart disease, I built
                a classification model that is capable of diagnosing patients with heart disease based on their resting blood pressure and cholesterol based on the k-nearest neighbour
                algorithm from tidyverse. Data science techniques were applied throughout the project to strengthen the accuracy and reliability of the model such as cross-validation to ensure the most
                optimal k value was chosen or data wrangling to ensure the raw data was kept tidy to avoid any errors when proccessing it in R. Visualizations where appropriate and informative
                in the forms of line and cluster plots were created thanks to tidymodels.
