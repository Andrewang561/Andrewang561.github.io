                <p>My name is Andrew Wang and I am currently a second year computer science student studying at the University of British Columbia. Throughout this online portfolio
                   you will learn about my qualifications, experiences, and hobbies. Let's get started!

                <p>I started my education at Ferris Elementary where I had an uneventful but fun childhood.</p>

                <p>After graduating from Ferris, I went to a secondary school called Richmond Secondary School. In this era of my life I was able to discover who I was as a person, met 
                some of my closest friends, and forged unforgettable memories. When I was grade 11 I enrolled in the Internation Baccalaureate Diploma Programme to give myself an extra
                challenge and push myself to become a more knowledgeable person. I successfully survived the dreaded IB program and received a score of 39/45. I graduated with two 
                diplomas, one from the provincial government and the other from IB, and maintained principle honour roll for all 5 years.</p>

                <p>Currently I am in my second year at UBC studying computer science. Through perserverance and determination, I survived my first year of university while
                    achieving a GPA of 4.3/4.33. However, my university story has just started and I can not wait to come back and update this website more and more with brand
                    new experiences as I continue my studies in computer science.

            <section id="Work Experience">
                <h3 id="Work Experience"><u>Work Experience:</u> </h3>
                <p>My first experience working was helping out around my parents restaurant by helping buy and deliver produce and bussing tables. But since it was unpaid, my first
                    real job was delivering newspaper for Richmond News. This was quite uneventful as it consisted of me walking around a neighbourhood with a cart full of heavy newspaper. The most
                    memorable moment was when I was walking towards a house and almost walked right into a giant spider and its web. Safe to say that house did not get its newspaper 
                    that day. The next job I had was as a math tutor for Cherrywood Learning Academy. My duties consisted of marking students homework, answering any questions they
                    may have, and making sure they stay focused. Later on my boss chose me to help plan out a pre-calculus curriculum for high school students as she felt that I had
                    a deep understanding of what mathematical skills are required to succeed in highschool. I currently work at Success For All Canada as a STEM tutor. I prepared students
                    for Singapore's International Mastery Contest Centre CS0 - Computational Thinking and Problem Solving Contest in Python. This involved guiding students through the basics
                    of Python and solving multiple choice and coding questions similar to LeetCode. Since this was the first time this program was offered in Success For All Canada, I also had
                    to solve all of the practice problems as well and create an answer key for future use. I teach other STEM subjects as well including calculus, physics, and chemistry.
